# Handoff Board

The change log for the Claude Code clones working on this repo (see "Who Works Where" in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)). Test reports from Antigravity go in [TEST_REPORTS.md](TEST_REPORTS.md).

- **Read this file at the start of every session.**
- **Add an item** when you changed something another session must know: behaviour, a rule, a migration, a shared utility.
- **Keep it short.** What is left to do goes in [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md), API shapes in [API.md](API.md), not here.
- **IDs:** `BE-###`, increasing. Check the highest number on `origin/claude` first, so the clones do not reuse one.
- **When this file passes about 300 lines,** move the older items to `docs/archive/`.

Items up to BE-234, including every `FE-###`, are in [archive/handoff-until-2026-11-03.md](archive/handoff-until-2026-11-03.md). Code comments that cite `docs/HANDOFF.md BE-###` with a lower number mean that file.

Item template:

```md
### BE-000 · Short title (owner 2026-10-03)
- **What changed:** ...
- **What to do about it:** ... (leave out if nothing)
```

---

### BE-235 · Docs tidied before the production walk (owner 2026-11-03)
- **What changed:** this board started fresh; its 2,300 lines of history and `BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` moved to `docs/archive/`. `docs/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` is rewritten by stage and checked against the code. `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `README.md` are rewritten to match the system as it is (Postgres, one builder, Chillwaa). `AGENTS.md` no longer calls the project a prototype, because the goal since 2026-11-03 is production.
- **What to do about it:** on `office-notebook`, an item added to the old board will conflict at the next merge. Keep the new `docs/HANDOFF.md` and add the item to it.
- **Egress check:** the live site runs BE-230 (`/api/spots` descriptions stop at 281 characters, no detail-only fields). Whether the shared cache saves downloads on Vercel is not proven yet; see stage 0 of the checklist.
