# Test Reports

Problems found by the tester (Antigravity) and their fixes by Claude Code. See "Who Works Where" in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Changes and announcements go in [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md), not here.

## How this file works

**Antigravity (tester)**
1. Works on the `tester` branch. Before each test round: `git fetch`, then merge `origin/claude` into `tester`.
2. Changes only this file, never code or data. Commits and pushes to `origin/tester` after each round.
3. Adds each new problem at the end of "Open", using the next `TR-###` number. One problem per report.
4. Re-tests reports marked `Ready to re-test`. If the problem is gone, sets `Status: Confirmed fixed`. If not, sets `Status: Open` and adds what it saw under `Evidence`.

**Claude Code**
1. Merges `origin/tester` into its working branch before changing this file, so both sides' edits are kept. The owner allows this one merge; the `tester` branch holds no code changes of its own.
2. After a fix, fills in `Fix` with the commit and sets `Status: Ready to re-test`. If a report is not a bug or needs the owner to decide, sets `Status: Needs owner` with the reason in `Fix`.
3. Moves a report to "Fixed" only after it says `Confirmed fixed`. Reports are never deleted.

**Severity**
- **Critical:** the site is broken, data is lost, or there is a security problem.
- **High:** a main task fails (sign in, join, post, admin save).
- **Medium:** something is wrong but there is a way around it.
- **Low:** cosmetic.

**Before reporting:** do not put passwords, tokens or members' private details in this file. The repo is shared.
